# Look Up App

Look Up App is a Flutter app study project made to learn more about the web functionalities of the framework, as well as API integration, pagination and multi device responsiveness.

## API

For this project I used the public [Spaceflight News API](https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v3/documentation). This API gathers data from several space news websites, including official company sources such as NASA and SPACEX, and lists in a very simple to use way.
